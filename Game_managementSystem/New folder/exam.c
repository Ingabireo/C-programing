/*I have used about to 6 functions to do this
* function 1: record_in_file it prompts a user to enter details of the match an then stores it in a file called game.txt
* function 2: display_all_games it reads the game.txt file and prints it to the screen
* Function 3: this is the challlenging function which has to print the teams that has a positive goal difference in all games I am going to explain it below
  @it opens game.txt file with two different pointers ptr1 and ptr so as to read the file in independently
  @ it uses two while loops one nestes in another so as to know  every team's goal difference
  @ it first declares a few variables to store the current team's details
  @ the variables name1 checks  current team name and then if it is the same team it finds the goal difference
  @if the result is positive or greater than zero to prints the team on the screen
  @ it uses another fucntion called check_ex() which checks if the team has not bean checked
